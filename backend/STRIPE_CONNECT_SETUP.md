## üéØ How the Commission System Works

### **Influencer Onboarding Flow:**
1. Influencer signs up for your platform
2. System creates Stripe Connect Express account
3. Influencer completes Stripe onboarding (bank account, verification)
4. Influencer is ready to receive commissions

### **Booking with Commission Flow:**
1. Client books appointment through influencer's profile
2. System calculates 15% commission
3. Stripe processes payment with automatic split:
   - **85%** goes to salon
   - **15%** goes to influencer
4. Commission is automatically transferred to influencer's bank account

### **Example Transaction:**
- **Service Fee**: $100
- **Platform Commission (20%)**: $20 ‚Üí Platform keeps $5, pays $15 to influencer
- **Salon Receives**: $80
- **Influencer Receives**: $15 (from platform's $20)
- **Platform Retains**: $5

## üí≥ Commission Structure

| Service Fee | Platform Commission (20%) | Salon Receives | Influencer Receives | Platform Retains |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| $50 | $10.00 | $40.00 | $7.50 | $2.50 |
| $100 | $20.00 | $80.00 | $15.00 | $5.00 |
